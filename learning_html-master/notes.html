	<h2>URL</h2>
	<body>
		<p>URL stands for <em>Uniform Resource Locator</em>. It contains serveral different parts, including:

			- the <strong>protocol</strong> : e.g. http, https, ftp
			- the <strong>host</strong> : e.g. www.facebook.com, www.bbc.co.uk
			- the <strong>path</strong>: e.g. /news/local, /john.smith.95

		<h2>DNS</h2>
		<body>
			<p>DNS stands for Domain Name System. You buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. 123-reg, GoDaddy). They arrange for your server's IP address to be added next to the domain name on a DNS server, so that people can find your site. This process can take a couple of days to spread out over the entire internet, as DNS servers take time to update one another using a 'gossiping' mechanism.
